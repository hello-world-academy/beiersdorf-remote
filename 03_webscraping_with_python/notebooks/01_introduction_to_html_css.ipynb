    "[Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language)  is not a programming language in the strict sense. It is rather a markup language that describes the structure of a web page. The basic building block of HTML is the so-called _element_. It allows content to be structured and provided with attributes.   \n",
    "\n",
    "## Elements\n",
    "\n",
    "An element can contain text, data, images, etc.. Typically an element starts with an opening tag `<...>`, contains attributes, encloses text and ends with a closing tag `</...>`.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "`<p>class=\"abcd\">Hello world!</p>`, \n",

    "- `<p>` opening _day_,\n",
    "- `class=\"abcd\"` an attribute and its value,\n",

    "This element contains an attribute but no closing tag (`</img>`) and no content.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Text\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Headings\n",
    "Heading elements make it possible to display individual text passages as headings of different sizes. HTML contains 6 predefined sizes (`<h1>`â€“`<h6>`).\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<h1>Heading 1st order</h1>\n",
    "<h2>Heading 2nd order</h2>\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "<p>I'm a paragraph</p>\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "### Images\n",

    "The `<img>` element inserts image files into the document. The `src` (_source_) attribute refers to the path to the image file (a local file or a _url_).\n",

    "# Basics of CSS\n",
    "\n",
    "Like HTML, [Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) is not a programming language but a _Stylesheet_ language. This can be used to format individual elements of a HTML document. To display all paragraph elements (`<p>`) in a HTML document in red text color, write the following in CSS:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Usually you create a CSS file and reference it within the `<head>` _tags_ in the HTML document.\n",
    "\n",
    "`<link href=\"styles/style.css\" rel=\"stylesheet\" type=\"text/css\">`\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Anatomy of CSS \n",
    "\n",
    "CSS formatting is based on rules. The name of the HTML element to be formatted (_selector_) is always at the beginning of the rule. (e.g. `p`).\n",
    "A rule like `color: red;` represents the selected element in the color red. The correct syntax is very important here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Each rule is enclosed by the curly brackets `{}`.\n",
    "* The colon `:` separates the property (e.g. `color`) from the value (e.g. `red`).\n",
    "* The semicolon (`;`) separates the declarations from each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "  width: 500px;\n",
    "  border: 1px solid black;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "There are various ways to address individual elements or groups of elements:\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "p, li, h1 {\n",
    "  color: red;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also address individual elements in different ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "* _Name_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `p`\n",
    "* _ID_ &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `#my-id`\n",
    "* Class &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;`.my-class`\n",
    "* Attributes &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `img[src]`\n",
    "* Status &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; `a:hover`\n",
    "\n",
    "Furthermore there are many more possibilities to address single elements with CSS ([see here](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css_selectors.asp)). \n",
    "\n",
    "### _Thinking in blocks_\n",
    "\n",
    "When defining CSS rules, it can help you to think of elements of an HTML document as boxes that can exist side by side and on top of each other (_box model_). With this model in mind, properties like `padding`, `border` and `margin` are easier to understand.\n",
