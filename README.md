Welcome to the workshop series _Coding for Non-Coder_. This repository provides learning materials and exercises. Feel free to download the materials.

In order to make use of the materials we recommend to use the [_conda_](https://conda.io/docs/) _package manager_. After installing conda you may install Python and all relevant additional packages by typing 

`conda env create -f environment.yml`

into the command line.

After the installation finished, please activate your virtual environment by typing 

`conda activate beiersdorf-remote`
