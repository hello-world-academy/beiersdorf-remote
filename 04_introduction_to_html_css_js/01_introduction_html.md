# Introduction

Modern websites usually consist of three components:
* HTML (Hypertext Markup Language)
* CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) and
* JavaScript (JS)

[__Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypertext_Markup_Language) is a text-based, machine-readable language (markup language, _markup language_) for the structuring of web content. These contents include texts, lists, tables, hyperlinks, images, etc. 

[__Cascading Stylesheets (CSS)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cascading_Style_Sheets) is a formal language used to define the appearance of HTML documents. It is a so-called "living standard". CSS is constantly being further developed by the [World Wide Web Consortium (W3C)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_Wide_Web_Consortium).
With this language, individual components of the website can be formatted and adapted to your own needs (including color, font size, font, spacing, etc.).

[__JavaScript (JS)__](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript) is a programming language that allows you to create interactive web content. Thus contents can be changed, loaded or generated by user interactions (input fields, animations, games etc.).

## Tools 

For this tutorial you need:

* A computer (Windows, macOS or Linux). Tablets, smartphones etc. are not (yet) recommended.
* A text editor to write code like [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), [Notepad++](https://notepad-plus-plus.org/), [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/), [Atom](https://atom.io/), etc. Classic word processing programs such as MS-Office or Pages are not recommended.
* A web browser to test your code. Current popular browsers include [Firefox](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/), [Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/browser/), [Safari](https://www.apple.com/safari/), [Internet Explorer](http://windows.microsoft.com/en-us/internet-explorer/download-ie), and [Microsoft Edge](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/microsoft-edge).
